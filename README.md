# setting-up-secure-Authentication-to-aws-api

I had already set up IAM users with specific roles and permissions from and earlier task.
I created a new role then gave it permissions of ec2 and s3 bucket full access.
I created access control - passwords to allow remote access to it from the command line.
I downloaded aws CLi. and used the correct prompts to gain access to the amazon resources.
